**favorite poem**

*The Lake Isle of Innisfree*
by William Butler Yeats

I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,   
And a smill cabin build there, of clay and wattles made:   
Nine bean-rows will I have there, a hive for the honey-bee,   
And live alone in the bee-loud glade   

And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,   
Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the criket sings;   
There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow,   
And evening full of the linnet's wings.   

I will arise and go now, for always night and day   
I hear lake water lapping with low sounds by the shore;   
While I stand on the roadway, or on the pavements grey,   
I hear it in the deep heart's core.
